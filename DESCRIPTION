Description: Elastic net regression models are controlled by two parameters,
  lambda, a measure of shrinkage, and alpha, a compromise between ridge and
  lasso regression.  glmnet provides tools for selecting lambda via cross
  validation but no automated methods for selection of alpha.  Elastic Net
  SearcheR automate the selection of both lambda and alpha.
